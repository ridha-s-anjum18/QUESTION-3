# QUESTION-3
Calculating  Fibonacci  Numbers


-Start


- initialize ' n '  for the number of terms and assign values to the variables as a1= 0 and a2= 1


-And initialize nextTerm for the nth term of Fibonacci


-Then it will give an output as "Enter the number of terms"


-The user will input the number as n 


-Now will use FOR LOOP 
 for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)   for the Fibonacci series 


-loop will start to print the first two terms of the Fibonacci series
 
-if  (i==1) it will display 0 as the first term of the Fibonacci sequence  


-if  (i==2) it will display 1 as the second term of the Fibonacci sequence 


-Now  we add both terms to get the third term for this we will use   
nextTerm = a1 + a2


-Then we will assign a1 the value of a2


-And assign a2 the value of  nextTerm 


-By printing nextTerm we will get the list of required Fibonacci terms 


-Stop
